# Git Practice 

This repository contains python scripts to generate NMR data as well as sample deep learning algorithms for my computational NMR projects.

## Getting Started

If you want to test out my scripts, you need to have python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine. I also use python packages that are pre-installed on anaconda. Thus, I recommend that you install ananconda.

### Prerequisites

Working PC (linux OS preferred) such as Ubuntu OS PC. For other platforms, please consult other sources.

### Installing Anaconda

Anaconda is not usually installed on Ubuntu machine. To install anaconda, click on this [link](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)

## Tensorflow

Once you have anaconda, you need to install Tensorflow on your anaconda environment in order to run the scripts.

## Built With

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) - A distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence
